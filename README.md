# gravity1
Calculating the trajectory of an object in gravitational motion

The program asks the user for the initial height and initial
velocity.
The program returns two lists, one containing the time data (50 points
over 5 seconds) and other containing the corresponding vertical position
for the give time of the projectile.
Additionally the program also returns a sketch of position versus
the time. Height is restricted so that it is always greater than 0.
